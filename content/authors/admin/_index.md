# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an applied theorist in macroeconomics and learning theory currently focusing on how agents form expectations and how that 
matters for and explains observed empirical behavior patterns. While my work is currently focused on the theory, it is always tied and backed up directly by the latest empirical findings, including my own work there.
